# Cloudflare Workers Free Plan Setup

This document explains how JasyAI is configured to work with Cloudflare Workers Free Plan and what changes were made to ensure compatibility.

## ✅ Deployment Status: SUCCESS

**Last Updated**: January 18, 2026  
**Deployment URL**: https://ai.jasyscom.workers.dev
**Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed to Free Plan  
**Cost**: $0/month for basic usage

The application has been successfully deployed and is running on Cloudflare Workers Free Plan without any paid features.

## ✅ Free Plan Compatible Features

### ✅ Included Features
- **Workers**: 100,000 requests per day
- **KV Storage**: 1 GB storage, 100,000 reads/day, 1,000 writes/day
- **D1 Database**: 5 GB storage, 5M reads/day, 100K writes/day
- **Workers Logs**: 200,000 events/day, 3 days retention
- **Hyperdrive**: 100,000 database queries/day

### ❌ Removed Paid Features
The following paid features have been removed from the configuration:

1. **CPU Limits** - Removed from `wrangler.toml`
   - Free plan: 10ms CPU time per request (automatic)
   - Paid plan: Custom CPU limits (was configured as 50,000ms)

2. **Durable Objects** - Not used in codebase
3. **Vectorize** - Not used in codebase  
4. **Queues** - Not used in codebase
5. **Rate Limits** - Not used in codebase

## 📋 Configuration Changes

### wrangler.toml
```toml
# BEFORE (Paid feature - caused deployment error)
[limits]
cpu_ms = 50000

# AFTER (Free plan compatible)
# Limits and Configuration
# CPU limits removed - not supported on Free plan
# [limits]
# cpu_ms = 50000
```

### Source Code Analysis
✅ **All source code is free plan compatible:**
- Uses only KV storage for data persistence
- No Durable Objects, Vectorize, or Queues usage
- Standard fetch API for external requests
- Basic Workers runtime features

## 🚀 Deployment Commands

```bash
# Test configuration locally
npm test

# Build (no-op for Workers)
npm run build

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging
```

## 📊 Usage Limits Monitoring

Monitor your free plan usage in the Cloudflare Dashboard:
1. Go to Workers & Pages
2. Select your Worker
3. View Analytics tab

## 🔄 Scaling Considerations

If you exceed free plan limits:
1. **Request limit**: Implement caching or upgrade to paid plan
2. **KV operations**: Optimize read/write patterns
3. **Storage**: Clean up old data regularly

## 🛠️ Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local development
npm run dev

# Test configuration
npm test
```

## ✅ Validation Results

The configuration has been validated and successfully deployed:
